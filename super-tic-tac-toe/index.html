        <div>
          <p>How to play Super Tic Tac Toe: Super Tic Tac Toe is like original Tic Tac Toe but with nine boards in a 3x3 grid. Notice that the nine boards are positioned in a 3x3 grid exactly as the cells on a Tic Tac Toe board.</p>
          <h3 id="first-move">First move</h3>
          <div>
            <p>The starting player can first choose any of nine boards, and then play on that board like in the original Tic Tac Toe game.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="following-moves">Following moves</h3>
          <div>
            <figure class="image"><img src="/supertictactoe/image/super-tic-tac-toe-2.png" alt="Following moves" height="264" width="264">
              <figcaption>Following moves</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The next player can't choose freely which board to play on, but must play on a board matching a cell played on the previous turn. For example, if you play at the first cell on any of the nine boards the next player must play onto the first board.</p>
            <p class="question">In the example, X played first in the cell number six so O must play next on the board number six (in yellow). Because O decided to play in the middle cell, X will play next on the middle board.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Important additional rule: If a board was already resolved (won or tied), a player can't obviously play on that board so the player can choose freely any unresolved board.</p>
          <h3 id="winning-the-game">Winning the game</h3>
          <div>
            <figure class="image"><img src="/supertictactoe/image/super-tic-tac-toe-3.png" alt="Winning the game" height="264" width="264">
              <figcaption>Winning the game</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The first player to get three boards in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins the game. Note that it's three boards instead of cells as compared to the original Tic Tac Toe game.</p>
            <p class="question">Here is an example of an almost completed game: It's O's turn on the yellow board, but it doesn't matter where O plays anymore, because X can win the top-right board which makes a line of three boards up-right.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Super Tic Tac Toe has no winning strategy, unlike the original Tic Tac Toe game, and I have very little to say about that. However, it's obvious that winning a single Tic Tac Toe board doesn't really mean much at all.</p>
